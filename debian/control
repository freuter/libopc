Description: Library for handling ISO/IEC 29500 container
 The Open Packaging Convention (OPC) is part of the ISO/IEC 29500 specification 
 which standardizes word-processing, spreadsheet and presentation documents. A 
 prominent implementer of the new standard is Microsoft Office Version 2007 and
 beyond. Every .docx, .xslx, .pptx document is an OPC container. Libopc has 
 functions to read/write OPC container.
 Another part of ISO/IEC 29500 is Markup Compatibility and Extensibility (MCE).
 Libopc also has features to parse and generate XML markup compatible with MCE.
